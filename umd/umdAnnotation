#id	Sample specific UMD id. (-1 means null data)
Variation_name_(cDNA_level)	cDNA level name of variant in HGVS format.
Variation_name_(protein_level)	protein level name of variant in HGVS format.
Mutation_type	Mutation type: transition mutation (Ts) in which the base change does not change the pyrimidine-purine orientation. Transversion mutation (Tv) in which the purine-pyrimidine orientation is changed to pyrimidine-purine or vice versa.
Variation_class	MS (missense), FS (frameshift), IFD (in frame deletion), IFI (in frame insertion, RGT (large rearrangement), NS (non-sens), ins/del (insertion-deletion), PTC (premature termination codon).
wt_codon	The wild-type codon for this variant.
wt_aa	The wild-type amino acid for this variant.
mutant_codon	The mutant codon for this variant.
mutant_aa	The mutant amino acid for this variant.
mutational_event	Sequence variation.
mutation_type	Mutation type: transition mutation (Ts) in which the base change does not change the pyrimidine-purine orientation. Transversion mutation (Tv) in which the purine-pyrimidine orientation is changed to pyrimidine-purine or vice versa.
Structure	Location of the variant on the known tridimensional structure.
Key_Residue_(HCD)	Highly conserved amino acid or interacting directly with a known partner.
Pyrimidin_doublet	Pyrimidine double.
CpG	CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide occurs next to a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its length. CpG stands for cytosine and guanine separated by a phosphate (-C-phosphate-G-), which links the two nucleosides together in DNA. The CpG notation is used to distinguish a cytosine followed by guanine from a cytosine base paired to a guanine.
At_the_mRNA_level	Mutation impact at the mRNA level.
On_restriction_map	Mutation on restriction map.
Sample_ID	Anonymous number of family.
Patient_status	Patient status.
Gender	Gender of the sample.
Transmission	Transmission of the variant for the sample.
Age_of_onset	Age of onset.
Family_type	Family type.
Reference_ID	Reference ID. (-1 means null data)
Reference	Documentation of whether the data has already been published.
Mutation_already_described_in_the_following_databases	A list of databases the mutation is already described in.
Method_of_analysis	Method of analysis.
spliceTYPE	Splice site type.
wtSEQ	Wild-type sequence.
CV	Common Variant score.
mutTYPESEQ	Mutant type sequence.
varPERCENT	Variation percent.
